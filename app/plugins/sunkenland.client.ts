/**
 * SunkenLand widgets (`sk-*` custom elements) are browser-only, so this runs
 * client-side. The package embeds its own Vue, and each preset is imported as
 * a Vite asset URL so it stays versioned with the dependency; `public/stickers`
 * ships the reaction sticker set.
 *
 * The elements talk to Stargate directly and cannot read the Nitro session
 * cookie, so `getAccessToken` hands them the signed-in user's Solar token
 * (served by `/api/sn/token`). That drives the widgets' signed-in state — the
 * reply composer posts as the user, the reaction list highlights their own
 * reactions — without a second Solarpass sign-in on top of better-auth.
 * Guests get `null` and see the widgets' signed-out states.
