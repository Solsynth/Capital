# User Agreement

Welcome to Solsynth’s products and services. This User Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) constitutes a legally binding agreement between you (hereinafter referred to as the “User” or “you”) and Solsynth LLC (hereinafter referred to as “we,” “us,” or “Solsynth”). It applies to all Solsynth products and services (hereinafter referred to as the “Services”), including but not limited to Solar Network, Solarpass, and others. Unless a specific product explicitly states additional terms, this Agreement serves as the governing framework for all Services.

By accessing, using our Services, or creating an account, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to this Agreement and any subsequent updates. If you do not agree with any terms of this Agreement, please immediately cease using our Services and delete your account.

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization or entity to this Agreement, and you ensure that the organization or entity complies with this Agreement.

To ensure clarity, the following keywords used in this Agreement have specific meanings:

- **May**: Indicates a permitted but non-mandatory action, which the User or we may choose to perform at our discretion.

- **Must**: Indicates a mandatory requirement that the User or we are obligated to follow; failure to comply constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

## Scope of the Agreement

1. This Agreement applies to all Solsynth Services, regardless of the device or method used to access them.
2. All Users are deemed to have agreed to this Agreement and its subsequent amendments. If you do not agree, please immediately cease using the Services and delete your account, which will be considered a termination of your User status.
3. In the event of any conflict, dispute, or incident (whether between Users and us or between Users), the latest version of this Agreement applies, regardless of when the incident occurred.
4. Solsynth reserves the right to the final interpretation of this Agreement. We retain the right to clarify or interpret terms as necessary.

## Modifications and Updates to the Agreement

1. Solsynth reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time to accommodate legal changes, technological updates, or business needs.
2. Upon updates, we **should** notify Users as soon as practicable. Notification methods include but are not limited to email, in-app notifications, official announcement posts, or website updates.
3. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated Agreement. If you do not agree with the updates, please cease using the Services and delete your account.
4. We **may** provide previews or solicit feedback before updates but are not obligated to do so.

## Provision, Interruption, and Termination of Services

1. Solsynth strives to provide equal access to Services for all eligible individuals worldwide, but availability may be subject to geographic, legal, or technical restrictions.
2. We do not guarantee the continuity, timeliness, security, or error-free operation of the Services. Services may be interrupted due to maintenance, upgrades, network failures, force majeure, or other reasons.
3. We reserve the right to suspend, modify, or terminate Services for any User at any time. When terminating Services, we **should** inform the User of the reason (unless prohibited by law).
4. Upon termination of Services, Users have the right to request the export or deletion of their personal data. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.
5. Age Requirement: Users **must** be at least 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in their country/region). If under the legal age, Users **must** obtain parental or guardian consent and use the Services under their supervision.

### Account Management and Security

1. Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their accounts, including passwords and access tokens. Users **must not** share account credentials.
2. If unauthorized use of an account is detected, Users **should** immediately notify us. We **may** assist in investigations but are not liable for any losses.
3. A natural person **may only** register and maintain one Solarpass account. We reserve the right to delete or merge duplicate accounts and retain related data.
4. Users **must not** transfer, sell, or rent accounts. Upon detection of such actions, we will immediately terminate the account.
5. Bot Accounts: Bot accounts created through the developer portal are exempt from the single-account restriction but **must** comply with the [Solar Network Developer Agreement](/terms/solar-network-dev-en).

### Penalties (Applicable to Services like Solar Network)

1. Upon violation of this Agreement, Users may face the following penalties, depending on the severity:
   - **Warning (Strike)**: No immediate impact but records the violation. Warnings are automatically lifted after 180 days without further violations. Repeated violations during the warning period will escalate penalties.
   - **Suspension**: Divided into “full suspension” and “partial suspension.”
     - Full Suspension: Users cannot access any Services, including logging into Solarpass. Typically time-limited.
     - Partial Suspension: Restricts specific functions, such as posting or uploading files.
   - **Ban**: Permanently disables the account and access to all Solsynth Services. We reserve the right to delete related data.
2. If Users create new accounts to bypass penalties, we will delete the new accounts and may extend or escalate the original penalty.
3. Users have the right to appeal penalties by submitting evidence to support@solsynth.dev. We will review and respond to appeals.

## Inappropriate Use

The following behaviors are considered inappropriate use, and we reserve the right to restrict functionality, issue warnings, suspend, or ban accounts:

1. **Malicious Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: Users **must** report vulnerabilities rather than exploit them. For example, exploiting an interface to repeatedly claim rewards.
2. **Abuse of APIs or Resources**: Generating spam, flooding, or wasting server resources. For example, using automated scripts to post hourly updates.
3. **Using Regular Accounts for Automation**: For example, using personal account tokens to develop chatbots. Users are encouraged to create bot accounts via the developer portal.
4. **Developing Non-Compliant Software**: Violating the [Solar Network Developer Agreement](/terms/solar-network-dev-en), such as modifying official clients to bypass subscription limits.
5. **Other**: Including but not limited to harassment, fraud, distributing malware, bypassing content filters, or any behavior that harms the platform’s ecosystem.

## User-Generated Content (UGC)

1. UGC Definition: Any content uploaded or created by Users through the Services.
2. Users bear full responsibility for their UGC. We do not pre-screen UGC but reserve the right to monitor and delete it.
3. Users **must** ensure that UGC complies with the laws of their country/region, including intellectual property, privacy, and anti-discrimination laws.
4. **Intellectual Property**:
   - By uploading UGC, Users grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, display, distribute, and promote UGC to operate the Services.
   - If UGC infringes third-party intellectual property, we will remove the content and issue warnings or suspensions based on repeated violations.
5. **Prohibited Content**: We **may** remove the following UGC and penalize the poster:
   - Content that infringes intellectual property, privacy (e.g., doxxing), or reputation.
   - Content that violates public morals, local laws, or international conventions (e.g., hate speech, violent threats, illegal content).
   - Spam, flooding, or meaningless content that wastes resources.
   - False, fraudulent, or misleading content.
6. **Privacy Settings**: We respect User settings (e.g., visible only to friends) and strive to protect data but are not liable for unintended leaks. See our Privacy Policy for details.
7. We **may** use UGC for analysis or service improvement, but it will be anonymized.

## Data Privacy and Security

1. We collect and process User data to provide Services. See our Privacy Policy for details (link: [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy-en)).
2. Users consent to our use of cookies, logs, and other technologies to track usage.
3. We implement reasonable security measures but are not liable for hacker attacks or data breaches. Users **should** use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.

## Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer

1. Services are provided “as is” without any express or implied warranties, including merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
2. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including data loss, loss of profits, or third-party claims.
3. Users agree to indemnify us for any losses, costs, or liabilities arising from their violations or UGC.
4. Force majeure events (e.g., natural disasters, wars) exempt us from liability.

## Termination
