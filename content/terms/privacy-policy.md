We only collect necessary personal information when providing our services. This includes:

- Email
- Phone number *optional*
- Name *optional*
- Address *optional*
- Date of birth *optional*
- Gender *optional*
- IP address
- Device identifiers
- User behavior data

## **Information Usage**

We use your personal information to:

- Provide the necessary data for our services
- Communicate with you about regulation updates or other important information
- Analyze our services to improve their quality
- Protect the security of your account and data

## **Data Sharing**

We will not sell or trade your personal information.

We share some of your personal information, which may include device identifiers and behavior data, with our partner, Google Analytics, to help us analyze and improve our services. For more details, please see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## **Data Security**

We implement strong security measures (including, but not limited to, using industry-leading encryption algorithms and a database key rotation policy) to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## **Your Rights**

Regardless of any penalties applied to your account, you always have the right to:

- Access the personal information we hold about you
- Request correction of your personal information
- Request deletion of your personal information

## **Data Storage**

Text data submitted by users is stored on our Tencent Cloud servers located in Hong Kong. User-uploaded files are stored on Cloudflare and Yumio's object storage services, depending on the user's selected file storage pool.

## **Data Deletion**

Except when a user requests it, we have the right to delete data submitted and uploaded by users to reclaim available resources, based on maintenance needs.

Before we proactively delete user data, we **should** notify the user and provide an opportunity for backup.

## **Data Export**

Users can export their personal information by contacting us at [lily@solsynth.dev](mailto:lily@solsynth.dev).

**NOTICE: Once the data export was done, we will delete the exported data in our database immediately. Which means you no longer have access to your Solarpass account. We use the email address we recieved the export request to validate your identity. And that's the final step in the process. We won't send any further confirmation emails.**
