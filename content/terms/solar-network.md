# **Solar Network Supplementary Terms**

These terms are intended to expand on the basic user agreement to better protect the rights and interests of both us and our users. Sections already stated in the basic user agreement will not be repeated.

## **Provision and Interruption of Services**

1. When a user violates the relevant regulations, they will receive one of three disciplinary actions: a **warning**, a **suspension**, or a **ban**.

   - **Warning (Strike)**: This will not have any actual impact on the user. A warning will be automatically removed after 180 days of no further negative behavior. If a user receives another warning within the warning period, the penalty will be upgraded to a suspension.
   - **Suspension**: Suspensions are divided into two types: **"full suspension"** and **"partial suspension."** In principle, a "full suspension" should have a specific duration.
     - **Full Suspension**: The user will not be allowed to access any Solar Network or other services and will be unable to log in to Solarpass.
     - **Partial Suspension**: This disables some of the user's rights, such as uploading files or posting.
   - **Ban**: This disables the user's entire account and all rights to use other Solsynth LLC services. We also reserve the right to delete related data.

2. A natural person can only register and own one Solarpass account. We have the right to delete data from any other sub-accounts belonging to the same user.
3. Users **must not** transfer or sell their Solarpass accounts. If such behavior is discovered, immediate action will be taken to delete the relevant data.
4. If a user attempts to evade a penalty by creating a sub-account during the penalty period, data from the sub-account should be deleted, and the original penalty may be upgraded or its duration extended as appropriate.
5. Robot accounts created through the **"Developer Portal"** are not considered sub-accounts. For regulations on the use of "robot accounts," please refer to the Developer Guidelines.

## **User-Generated Content**

1. **User-Generated Content (UGC)** is defined as any content uploaded by a user on the Solar Network, including but not limited to text, images, videos, and audio.
2. Regarding files uploaded by users on the Solar Network, or posts and other content published on the Solar Network, from the moment of upload, the user is considered to have granted us the necessary rights to display the content.
3. We will respect the user's privacy settings (such as visible only to friends, etc.) for content published on the Solar Network and will do our best to protect user data from being leaked. However, we do not assume responsibility for unexpected data leaks.
